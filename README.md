# Compass A Question Bank v2 (1,750)

## What changed (high-level)
This bank was rebuilt to **reduce repetition** across question types and to make **answer choices meaningfully different**.

Key upgrades:
- **Multiple stem archetypes** (not the same “priority finding” wording over and over).
- **SATA variety** (interventions, expected vs unexpected, teaching, documentation, order clarification, risk of deterioration).
- **Bowtie fixed**: answers always match options; options vary; no “defaulting” to the correct answer.
- **Case-tabs for most questions**: case study + vitals + labs + nursing actions + MD orders.
- **Lab panels vary by system/condition** (not the same labs repeated).
