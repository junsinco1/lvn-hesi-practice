LVN HESI PRACTICE — v22.1 (FIXED) TOPIC-VARIED PROGRESSIVE — 1000 CLUSTERS

THIS FIXES:
• Previous zip mistakenly included an empty questions.json.
• This package includes a VERIFIED non-empty questions.json (1000 clusters).

WHAT'S INSIDE:
• questions.json — 1000 progressive patient clusters
  - baseline: single (action/interpretation/teaching rotates)
  - deterioration: SATA (varied intent) + single
  - post-intervention: SATA + NGN bowtie
• Topics match your EXACT topic strings.
• Timeline: baseline → deterioration → post-intervention with lab trends.

INSTALL:
1) Upload/replace questions.json in the SAME folder as index.html on GitHub Pages.
2) Hard refresh.
