LVN HESI Practice WebApp v4.3 DEBUG (NO SERVICE WORKER)

Use this if GitHub Pages caching is breaking updates.
- Service worker registration DISABLED
- app.js cache-busted: app.js?v=43
- Visible on-screen error overlay if JS fails
- Diagnostics button included

Deploy:
Upload ALL files in this zip to the SAME GitHub Pages folder as index.html.
Then hard refresh.

Once stable, you can switch back to the PWA version.


v4.4 fix: prevents mastery from being null (localStorage may contain 'null').
