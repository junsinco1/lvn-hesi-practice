RECOVERY BUILD (No Cache / No Service Worker)

Upload ALL files in this folder to the SAME GitHub Pages folder (usually repo root).

Then open:
  https://<yourname>.github.io/<repo>/index_app.html?v=999

If anything fails, open Diagnostics inside the app and copy the "Load errors" lines.

Important:
- Remove any old service-worker.js from the repo (this build does not use it).
- Hard refresh once: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) / Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
- iOS: Settings > Safari > Advanced > Website Data > delete your site, then reload.
