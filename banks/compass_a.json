He suddenly develops bradycardia.\n\nCurrent Assessment:\nBP: 82/50 (previous 128/76)\nHR: 42 bpm (previous 88 bpm)\nRR: 24 breaths/min\nSpO2: 92% on 2L NC\nECG: ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF with new second-degree AV block type II\nTroponin I: 3.8 ng/mL (normal <0.04)\nClient states: \"I feel really nauseous and dizzy\"\nSkin: Cold, clammy, diaphoretic\n\nThe provider has ordered nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL PRN for chest pain.

    "answer": "Apply transcutaneous pacing pads immediately and prepare to initiate pacing",
    "rationale": "This client has an inferior wall STEMI (ST elevation in II, III, aVF) with development of second-degree AV block type II accompanied by hemodynamic instability (BP dropped from 128/76 to 82/50, symptomatic bradycardia at 42 bpm). Type II blocks are infranodal and can suddenly progress to complete heart block, causing cardiac arrest. Transcutaneous pacing is the priority intervention. CRITICAL: Nitroglycerin is CONTRAINDICATED in inferior MI with suspected right ventricular involvement - it causes venodilation, decreases preload, and will worsen the hypotension. Atropine is ineffective for second-degree type II blocks because the conduction problem is below the AV node.",

      "Administer the nitroglycerin as ordered to relieve chest pain and improve cardiac perfusion": "Incorrect - nitroglycerin is contraindicated in RV infarction; will cause severe hypotension",
      "Apply transcutaneous pacing pads immediately and prepare to initiate pacing": "Correct - second-degree type II block with hemodynamic instability requires immediate pacing",

      "Administer atropine 0.5 mg IV push to increase the heart rate above 60 bpm": "Incorrect - atropine ineffective for type II AV block"
