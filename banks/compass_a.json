    "rationale": "NGN clinical judgment for psych/mental health emergencies: (1) Analyze case data to identify primary life-threatening problem, (2) Select priority interventions addressing underlying pathophysiology, (3) Predict measurable outcomes demonstrating stabilization. Bowtie structure mirrors clinical reasoning: problem\u2192action\u2192outcome. For psych/mental health emergencies focus on ABCs, time-sensitive treatments, complication prevention. Use objective data (vitals, labs, symptoms) to confirm diagnosis, select interventions matching severity/urgency, predict outcomes using measurable parameters."
